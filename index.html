            <h2>Introduction to Global Warming</h2>
            <p>
                If we suppose that planet Earth is four and a half billion years old, then the phenomenon of global
                warming is just approximately two hundred years old.
            </p>
            <p>
                What exactly is global warming? Simply expressed, it is the rise in temperature in the lowest layer of
                the Earth's atmosphere due to the production of vast volumes of carbon dioxide, methane, and other
                gases.
            </p>
            <p>
                What connection exists between rising temperatures and greenhouse gas emissions? The mechanism of global
                warming itself holds the answer. It is well recognized that the sun is the planet Earth's main source of
                heat.
            </p>
            <p>
                Furthermore, once sunlight strikes the Earth's surface, a portion of the heat is naturally absorbed,
                while the remainder of the heat is reflected back into space.
            </p>
            <p>
                During this process, heat passes through the atmosphere, which today contains large amounts of carbon
                dioxide and methaneâ€”commonly referred to as greenhouse gases.
            </p>
            <p>
                The issue lies in the fact that greenhouse gases have a remarkable capacity to absorb heat, preventing
                surface-reflected heat from escaping into space and trapping it within the Earth's atmosphere. As a
                result, this contributes to an increase in global temperature.

            <h3 class="mb-4">Global Warming and Its Impact on Egypt</h3>

            <p>If we suppose that planet Earth is four and a half billion years old, then the phenomena of global
                warming is just approximately two hundred years old. Simply expressed, it is the rise in temperature in
                the lowest layer of the Earth's atmosphere, due to the production of vast volumes of carbon dioxide,
                methane, and other gases.</p>

            <p>The connection between rising temperatures and greenhouse gas emissions lies in the mechanism of global
                warming itself. It is well recognized that the sun is the planet Earth's main source of heat. Once
                sunlight strikes the Earth's surface, a portion of the heat it transmits is absorbed, while the
                remainder is reflected and returned to space. However, greenhouse gases in the atmosphere absorb this
                heat, preventing it from escaping and contributing to an increase in temperature.</p>

            <h2 class="mt-4">Impacts on Egypt</h2>
            <p>Egypt is already located in a hot region, and global warming has significant economic and environmental
                implications. The most notable impacts include:</p>

            <h3>1. Rising Sea Levels</h3>
            <p>Studies suggest that by the end of the century, sea levels in Alexandria and the Nile Delta might rise by
                50 to 100 centimeters. Approximately 7 million people would be impacted, and around 30% of food
                production in these areas would be at risk if 12% to 15% of the Delta's lowlands were submerged.</p>

            <h3>2. Water Scarcity and Drought</h3>
            <p>97% of Egypt's water demands are met by the Nile River. Global warming may decrease the flow of the Nile
                by as much as 15% by 2050, severely affecting Upper Egypt's agriculture and irrigation.</p>

            <h3>3. Effects on Agriculture</h3>
            <p>Over the next several decades, Egypt's temperature is predicted to increase by 2 to 3 degrees Celsius.
                This rise could significantly affect crop output, with wheat yields potentially declining by up to 11%
                and maize by 19%.</p>

            <h3>4. Increased Heat in Major Cities</h3>
            <p>Cairo may experience a considerable increase in the number of intense heat wave days, jumping from 8 days
                at the beginning of the century to approximately 50 days by 2050.</p>

            <h3>5. Health Impacts</h3>
            <p>Rising temperatures will lead to increased heat-related disorders, particularly in cities like Cairo,
                Giza, and Aswan, along with declining air quality leading to more respiratory ailments.</p>

            <h2 class="mt-4">Monitoring Greenhouse Gases</h2>
            <p>Methane (CH4) and carbon dioxide (CO2) concentrations are measured using various sophisticated methods:
            </p>

            <ul>
                <li><strong>Infrared Absorption Analysis:</strong> This technique relies on the gases' ability to absorb
                    infrared light at specific wavelengths.</li>
                <li><strong>Laser Analysis:</strong> Methods like Tunable Diode Laser Absorption Spectroscopy measure
                    gas concentrations through laser beams.</li>
                <li><strong>Laboratory Examination:</strong> Air samples are analyzed in labs using equipment like mass
                    spectrometers and gas chromatography.</li>
                <li><strong>Satellite Sensing:</strong> Satellites like TROPOMI and GOSAT gather data on global gas
                    quantities through light absorption.</li>
                <li><strong>Ground Monitoring Stations:</strong> Fixed sensors assess gas concentrations continuously,
                    such as the Mauna Loa Observatory.</li>
                <li><strong>Drones:</strong> Drones equipped with sensors monitor gas concentrations in hard-to-reach
                    areas.</li>
            </ul>
